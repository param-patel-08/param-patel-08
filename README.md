## Hi there 👋

Hi there, I'm Param Patel 👋
🎓 Software Engineering Student at Auckland University of Technology

I’m a passionate and driven software engineering student at AUT, always eager to learn and explore new technologies in the fields of software development and data management. I thrive on tackling complex problems through creative engineering and collaboration, constantly seeking opportunities to grow both technically and personally.

I’m currently open to Software Engineering and Internship opportunities and would love to hear from you if you know of any roles that might be a good fit! 😊

🌱 I'm currently working on and learning:
Foodie Buddy - Restaurant Recommendation App
A full-stack mobile application developed using React Native and TypeScript. This app helps users find restaurants of their liking nearby. The project was implemented using Scrum methodologies, with user stories planned on Trello, design prototypes created on Figma, and the app deployed on Expo Go. We used APIs like the Places API, Directions API, and OpenAI API to create a "buddy" chatbot that offers personalized recommendations. This project has provided me with valuable insights into how corporate companies work in sprints, develop, test, and deploy software in an Agile environment.

Time Management and Leadership in Community Service
As a Youth Leader at BAPS and Secretary of the Computer Science and Engineering Association (CSEA), I have organized and led numerous events. I always reflect on what went well, what could be improved, and what participants enjoyed, incorporating feedback to continuously enhance the experience. This has honed my skills in project management, teamwork, and event organization, and has taught me the importance of reflection and continuous improvement.

MongoDB and Node.js
Learning MongoDB and Node.js to build robust backends for web and mobile applications. I’m currently exploring how to connect and manage databases using MongoDB Compass and working on setting up RESTful APIs.

🏆 Achievements:
Secretary Position at the Computer Science and Engineering Association (CSEA) at AUT.
